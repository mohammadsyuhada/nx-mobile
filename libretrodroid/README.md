# libretrodroid (nx-mobile's runner)
The native libretro runner for nx-mobile: C++ frontend, JNI and the Kotlin `GLRetroView` API. The app reaches it only
through `EmulatorRunner` in `shared/`.

## Credits
This module is a fork of [LibretroDroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/LibretroDroid) by Filippo Scognamiglio
([@Swordfish90](https://github.com/Swordfish90)), the C++ libretro frontend library that powers
[Lemuroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid). The runner core, its renderers, audio, input, save states and
the Kotlin `GLRetroView` API are his work; nx-mobile builds on top of them.

The fork started at upstream commit `8835c30` (after release `0.14.0`) and does not track upstream after that. Its
development history, including every upstream commit with its original author, is kept in
[mohammadsyuhada/nx-libretrodroid](https://github.com/mohammadsyuhada/nx-libretrodroid). Upstream copyright headers
are kept unchanged in the source. Like LibretroDroid, it is licensed under the GPL-3.0.

## Inherited from LibretroDroid
* 2D and GL cores
* Audio
* Gamepad events
* Save states and SaveRAM serialization
* Simple shader effects (CRT and LCD)
* Touchscreen
* Multiple disk support
* Core variables

## Added in nx-mobile
* **RetroAchievements (rcheevos 12.2.1, softcore).** `achievementsEnable(true)` before `create()` starts an rc_client.
  The runner reads core memory (`SET_MEMORY_MAPS` or `retro_get_memory_data`), calls `rc_client_do_frame` after each
  `retro_run`, and hands every HTTP request to the host through `GLRetroView.getAchievementServerCalls()`; the host
  answers with `achievementsServerResponse`. Events arrive on `getAchievementEvents()`, with the achievement list,
  summary and signed award request exposed to the app. `LibretroAchievements.hash` identifies a game from fds
  (cue/bin, m3u, CHD via libchdr) without a core loaded.
* **Core options v1/v2** with rich metadata and category info, and option visibility refresh.
* **Display:** scale modes (fit, integer, stretch), a screen offset and the game geometry; nearest or linear sampling
  on the default shader; the last frame is redrawn while paused; display settings set before `create()` are kept.
* **RetroArch GLSL preset chains** (`.glslp`), with shader chain and parameter setters, error reporting and the core's
  texture bindings kept around the chain.
* **Screen regions** for multi-screen layouts such as the NDS: draw chosen regions of the core frame, blended by
  alpha and sampled linearly when downscaled, with touches mapped back through the regions and `sendPointer`.
* **Input:** analog L2/R2 trigger values for cores that read `ANALOG_BUTTON`, and controller port devices set after
  load and before the first frame (`controllerPorts`).
* **Hardware-rendered cores:** hardware contexts the GLES view cannot serve are refused, `isHardwareRendered()`
  reports whether the core renders on the GPU, and a GL core's state is neutralised and restored around every frame
  draw.
* **GL frame sizing and timing** (for Dreamcast and similar GL cores): the framebuffer is sized to the largest frame
  the core delivers, clamped to the GPU limit, and `retro_run` is paced at the frame rate a core reports through
  `SET_SYSTEM_AV_INFO`, handed to the GL thread through atomics.
* **VFS v3 and v4** (stat, mkdir, directory listing, 64-bit stat), honouring the version the core requests; fdopen'd
  descriptors are closed once.
* **GL debug output** (opt-in `glDebugOutput`, debug builds): driver messages to the `NXGL` log tag through
  `KHR_debug`, with a `glGetError` fallback and a frame/audio probe.
* **Robustness:** the whole environment resets between cores, a core whose create or load failed is deinitialised
  before it is closed, the view fails fast instead of waiting on a detached or wedged emulation thread, serialized
  state and SRAM buffers are freed, and a zero core aspect ratio falls back to base width over height.
* **Netplay:** lockstep engine (`cpp/netplay/`, ported from NX Redux; protocol 3: 10-byte input with sticks, no PAUSE sent) hooked into `step()`/input; `LibretroNetplay` JNI.
* **Build:** compile SDK 37 (the app sets `targetSdk`).

## Tests
- Kotlin: `./gradlew :libretrodroid:testDebugUnitTest`
- Native host checks (no device): each `src/test/cpp/*_test.cpp` has its build-and-run command in its header comment;
  run it from the repo root.
