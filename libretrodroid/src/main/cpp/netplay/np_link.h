/*
 * GBA link over TCP (the handheld's GBALink), for cores with the libretro netpacket interface: gpSP (wireless adapter,
 * cable fakes, real cable) and mGBA (real cable). No input exchange and no state sync: each device runs its own game
 * on its own save, and the core's packets cross the wire as they are.
 *
 * Wire: 5-byte header [cmd u8][size u16 BE][client_id u16 BE], payload <= 2048. The client sends an empty READY; the
 * host answers READY with its link mode ("auto\0", or no payload). The host sends HEARTBEAT after 500 ms with nothing
 * sent, the client echoes each one; 60 s without a packet ends the session. PAUSE carries 1 (menu open) or 0.
