/**
 * Cores read BIOS/asset files from an app-owned system directory. On the target phone the app cannot read
 * files pushed by adb into its external dir, so everything is copied by the app itself, from the APK's
 * assets/system/, once per app update (stamped with lastUpdateTime).
 *
 * MainActivity pre-warms it on a background thread (as it does the overlays and shaders) and every caller goes
 * through one lock, so a game started meanwhile waits for that copy instead of running a second one.
 * Not [BundledAssets.sync]'s whole-tree swap: this dir is not the APK's alone. BiosImport copies the user's
 * `Bios/<TAG>/` files into it (by path, over bundled ones) and cores write their own files here (flycast's
 * `dc/` nvmem and flash, PPSSPP's), and a swap would drop all of that. So each bundled file is built beside its
 * target and renamed over it (a core or a reader sees the old file or the new, never half of one), and the stamp
 * is written last: a copy cut short (killed, disk full) has no stamp and is redone on the next call.
