/**
 * The client's (and a host on another core's) session copy of the saves: `files/netplay/session/`, outside `sd/` so
 * nothing in it is ever taken for the real saves. The host's saves arrive through [sink].
 *
 * Ownership (one copy folder; game screens may overlap in launcher mode): a [sink] commit leaves the copy unclaimed.
 * The game screen that plays on it [claim]s it, writing its own id to [OWNER_FILE]; a copy another screen had claimed is
 * stale (that screen's session is over) and is emptied first. At its end a screen [release]s the copy, which deletes it
 * only while the marker still holds that screen's id, so an old screen torn down after a new launch never deletes the
 * new session's copy. The app-start sweep ([sweepOnce]) runs once per process: at a process's first start no session of
 * that process exists yet, and a later MainActivity (recreated mid-session, or between a commit and its launch) never
 * touches a live or just-committed copy.
 *
 * One JVM lock (this object's monitor) covers [claim], [release], the sweep, a sink's setup and its begin / commit /
 * abort, and a host's delete + claim + copy ([prepareHost], called from GameActivity), so a screen's release or a new
 * join's sink never interleaves with another screen's handoff.
