/**
 * Dual mode's stand-in on the top screen while an app opened there runs ([AndroidAppLauncher.launch]). Our window on that
 * display (a presentation) sits above every app window, so it goes down while the app runs, and Android tells no one
 * when another app's task leaves a display. This invisible activity, in a task of its own on that display, starts the
 * app over itself; when it shows again (the app finished, went to the back or crashed) the app has left the top screen:
 * [onChange] brings the menu's top screen back, and it closes. A newer host closes the older one. Something else covering
 * the host (a home on that display) is not seen this way: [recheck] and [release] are the other ways back.
 *
 * The menu's window on that display goes down before the host starts ([start]): over it, the system never shows the
 * translucent host (Samsung DeX left it invisible and never created). A host not created within [HOST_TIMEOUT_MS] is
 * removed and the app opens there directly ([direct]).
