/**

 * and [defaultTags] are the settings it was built for; [systems] holds every system the scan found (empty home
 * skeleton folders and coreless tags included), before the playable filter, in library order. Refs are
 * `ContentRef.value` strings. The core is not stored: it comes from the tag when the index is shown. [offline] holds the
 * ids of extras that were on unmounted storage at scan time: they are in [extras] (the index still fits the settings)
 * but none of their games are, and a start that finds one mounted again scans. [lateMount] is the subset whose volume
 * was mounted yet still did not list (the provider can lag the mount): kept for one more scan, then dropped.
 * [scannedAt]: when the scan that built it finished (epoch ms), for Settings -> Library; null when unknown (an index from
 * before the field, or a platform with no clock). Not part of the fit, so no version bump.
