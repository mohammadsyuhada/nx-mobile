 * One value row's setting as it is now, bound to that row (a tab's, a console's, a hint's): [values] in the order
 * LEFT / RIGHT step through them, the [current] one, how to [set] another, and what the page does [after] a change
 * (republish, plus any side effect: Home rebuilt, the tab row's focus dropped, a rumble preview). Settings' rows
 * ([AppState]'s `settingValue`) and RetroAchievements' build one per press, so LEFT / RIGHT, A and the touch chooser
 * are one generic path each; onboarding's value rows [step] the same settings without [after] (they republish their
 * own page). A two-value row (an On / Off, Show / Hide or two-choice row) steps by flipping.
