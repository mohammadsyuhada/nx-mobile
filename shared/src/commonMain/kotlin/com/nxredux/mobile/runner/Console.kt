/**
 * A console groups the tags that run it. On the handheld a tag is "console + emulator" (`GBA` = gpsp,
 * `MGBA` = mgba), each with its own Saves/<TAG>/; here saves are one folder per console, Saves/<console tag>/
 * ([defaultTag], NxPaths.savesDir), and states stay per tag. [tags] are in preference order: the first is the built-in
 * default (Settings → Default emulators picks another). A folder's tag only names its console: a game runs its own
 * Emulator pick (`systems.txt`), else the console's Default emulators one, whichever of the console's folders holds it.
 * [aliases] are folder names that mean this console, lowercase. [extensions] are set explicitly: the extensions this
 * console's games use, which may be a subset of its cores' (never an archive extension, even for fbneo, whose zip/7z its
 * core loads as is ([CoreRegistry.loadsArchive]); empty for SGB and FBN, which are reached only by folder, sidecar or
 * menu). [rawSram]: the battery save is raw SRAM and interchangeable between the console's tags.
