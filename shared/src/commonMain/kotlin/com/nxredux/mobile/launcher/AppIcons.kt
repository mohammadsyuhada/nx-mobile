/**
 * Android apps' icons by id, each asked of [launcher] once: tiles look an app's icon up here instead of loading it on
 * every composition. The full-colour icon and the [mono] one (its [AppLauncher.silhouette]) are kept apart. A missing
 * one (null) is kept too; its tile draws the generic app glyph. Loads run in [scope], so
 * tiles asking at once share one, and one finishes for the cache when its tile leaves. [retain] drops the icons no
 * longer shown (the picker's), so the cache does not grow for the session. Main thread only.
